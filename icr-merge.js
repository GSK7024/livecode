// icr-merge.js — the bridge that brings ICR into the live product, SAFELY.
//
// Hivecode's reconcile() merges concurrent edits with merge3() (a line-level 3-way
// merge). merge3 is convergent: across many peers it always settles on one canonical
// text. ICR's structural merge produces a DIFFERENT canonical form (it may reorder or
// reformat). Mixing two merge algorithms in a live multi-peer sync means the same logical
// content has two byte-forms, and peers ping-pong between them — which corrupts files
// (duplicated/*dropped* lines). So we do NOT change merge bytes with ICR here.
//
// Instead ICR runs in ADVISORY mode: merge3 still produces the bytes (full convergence
// preserved, identical to pre-ICR behavior), and ICR runs alongside purely to DETECT the
// meaning-level problems a line merge can't see — a dangling reference, a rename, a
// same-declaration clash — and surface them as a warning on the activity feed. This ships
// ICR's core value (catching semantic breaks) with zero divergence risk.
//
// ICR's full structural/rename AUTO-MERGE lives in the library (icr.js) and is proven by
// the test suite + fuzzer; turning it on in the product is a later step that needs a
// format-preserving, single-canonical-form merge so peers can't diverge.
