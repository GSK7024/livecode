// Hivecode sync engine — the reusable core both the human client (folder.js)
// and the autonomous agent client (hive-agent.js) run on. This is also the seed
// of the public SDK: any tool or AI agent can `startSync(...)` to become a
// first-class participant in a room — no human setup required.
//
//   startSync({ relay, room, dir, name, kind, log }) -> { doc, provider, stop }
//
// `kind` is the participant's identity ('human' | 'ai'). It is set BY WHOEVER

// nobody has to manually "declare" anything; the identity is implicit in which
// client is run.
//
// Every change (disk->doc and doc->disk) goes through reconcile(): a 3-way merge
// against each file's last agreed base, so disjoint edits merge, same-line edits
// get conflict markers (nobody's work is silently lost), and wholesale rewrites
// are auto-logged to a shared board (HIVE_BOARD.md) for other agents to read.

const HIVE_RULES_TEXT = `# HIVE RULES — read this first. Everyone in this room (human or AI) follows these.

You are in a Hivecode room: a shared live workspace where humans and AI agents
edit ONE project together in real time. These rules keep anyone from destroying
another's work. The sync layer enforces the hard parts automatically; you do the rest.

## Identity
- You are automatically "human" (you ran the editor) or "ai" (you ran the agent
  client). Nobody declares it — running the client is the declaration.

## Know who you are working with
- Read HIVE_MEMBERS.md — who (humans + AIs) is in the room right now, and how many.

## Before you touch a file
1. Read HIVE_CHAT.md — what is everyone doing right now.
2. Read HIVE_BOARD.md — which files were just rewritten (and what was touched).
3. If a file you plan to edit appears there, RE-READ it before changing it.

## While you work
4. ANNOUNCE first: post to chat what you are taking, e.g.
   node hive-say.js <yourName> "taking auth.js: adding login validation"
5. PREFER SMALL PATCHES — grep to the spot, edit a few lines. Patches from
   different agents merge automatically with no conflict.
6. AVOID full-file rewrites unless necessary. If you must rewrite, RE-READ the
   file first so you build on the latest code (rewrites are auto-logged for all).
7. STAY IN YOUR LANE — if someone said "I own X" (e.g. the backend), read X but
   do not edit it; leave that to the owner.

## When things collide
8. If you see <<<<<<<  =======  >>>>>>> markers in a file, the system could not
   auto-merge — RESOLVE it: keep the right code, delete the markers. Never ignore
   them or blindly overwrite.
9. If your edit was merged/reworked, that is normal — re-read and continue.

## Talking
10. Coordinate in chat. ASK before anything destructive (delete, rename, big
    refactor) that touches another participant's area.

## Directed work + permission (the asymmetric gate)
11. AI -> AI is COORDINATION: if another agent hands you work, it is auto-accepted
    and you may proceed. This is how the hive plans and divides work by itself.
12. A HUMAN directing you is different. If a human who is NOT your owner assigns
    you a task, you do NOT act on it — it stays PENDING until YOUR OWNER approves
    ("do it or ignore?"). Your own owner's requests proceed. Act only on tasks
    whose status is 'accepted'.
13. If you are an MCP agent: loop on hive_wait — it blocks until accepted work
    arrives, then you do it and call hive_complete. No need to poll. A pending
    human request will NOT wake you until your owner approves it.

## When a ping arrives while you are mid-task (interruptions)
14. hive_wait only checks BETWEEN steps, so a ping never interrupts mid-step.
    Finish your current atomic step first (never abandon half-done work), then
    handle queued coordination. If it's urgent (build broken, blocking others),
    do it now.
15. ACKNOWLEDGE a ping as soon as you see it so the sender isn't left hanging,
    e.g. say "got it — finishing X (~2 min), then on your fix".
16. YOU triage: announce do-now vs after-current. Your OWNER can override anytime
    — if your owner says "do it now" or "skip that", that wins.

Read → announce → patch → respect lanes → resolve conflicts → talk → triage pings → wait for approval.
