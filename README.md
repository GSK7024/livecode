<h1>Hivecode</h1>

**Oversight and control for your AI coding agents.**

Run AI agents on your codebase and actually stay in control: **watch** every edit
live, **fence** each agent to the folders it's allowed in, **approve** the risky
moves, and **undo** any agent instantly. No git push/pull. Open source.

## Why

You can't trust an AI agent blindly. The faster it edits, the more you have to
check — and the moment you run more than one, it gets worse: they touch files they
shouldn't, overwrite each other, and you lose track of who changed what. Today's
answer is to isolate each agent in a git worktree and pray at merge time — which
doesn't help you *trust* the output, it just defers the mess.

Hivecode adds the missing layer: **oversight and control.**

- **See everything** — a live Control Room (browser or phone) shows every agent and every file it touches, in real time.
- **Fence them in** — folder-scoped access the relay enforces; an out-of-scope agent never even receives the code.
- **Approve what matters** — gate risky work so nothing lands without your OK.
- **Undo anything** — instant rollback: restore any file, or revert *everything* one agent did.

It's **agent-neutral**: Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, or your own bot over MCP. No
git push/pull — edits sync in about a second.

## Quickstart

1. Install the extension (link above). It works in **VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf,
   and Antigravity**.
2. Open the folder you want to share (**File → Open Folder**).
3. `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P` → **Hivecode: Host a Secured Session**. A join link is
   copied to your clipboard. *(No terminal, no server to run.)*
4. **Hivecode: Invite to folders…** → pick the folders and a role (edit /
   read-only) for each person or agent. Send them the link.
5. They run **Hivecode: Join a Session** and paste the link. You're now editing
   the same project live.

Use **Manage access** to re-scope or revoke anyone, and **Leave Session** to stop.

## Add an AI agent

Agents join through the Hivecode MCP server ([`hive-mcp.js`](hive-mcp.js)). Set it
up once, then just hand the agent a join link; it appears in the room as an `ai`
member, scoped to exactly the folders you invited it to.

- **[JOIN_WITH_AGENT.md](JOIN_WITH_AGENT.md)** — step-by-step for a *human*: set up MCP, then bring your agent in.
- **[AGENT_MANUAL.md](AGENT_MANUAL.md)** — written *for the agent*: how to set itself up and join (drop it in your project as `CLAUDE.md` so the agent reads it automatically).
- **[MCP.md](MCP.md)** — the full tool reference.

## What you get

**Oversight & control** *(the point of the whole thing)*
- **Live Control Room** — watch every agent and every file it touches in real time,
  from any browser or your phone. No more "what is it even doing right now?"
- **Folder-scoped access** — invite an agent to `frontend/` only; it never receives
  anything else (relay-enforced, not trust-based).
- **Approval gates** — risky work waits for your OK; agent-to-agent coordination
  flows automatically.
- **Instant rollback** — restore any file to an earlier point, or **revert
  *everything* one agent did** in a click. Undo a rogue agent without touching the
  rest of the team's work.
- **Mission control** — pause, resume, or reassign any agent; agents honor it
  mid-task.
- **Instant revoke** — cut access mid-session, enforced server-side on every
  reconnect (and it survives a relay restart).
- **Read-only roles** — reviewers see everything, change nothing.

**Coordination**
- **Built-in chat**, a **shared task board** (assign / complete), and **live
  presence** so humans and agents stay in sync.
- **Co-editing heads-up** before two people touch the same file.
- **Never lose work** — overlapping edits keep both versions with conflict markers;
  a stale rewrite can't silently delete another's lines.

**Trust**
- **Server-enforced auth** — signed tokens, algorithm-pinned, fail-closed.
  Unauthorized clients never complete the WebSocket handshake.
- **Self-certifying secured rooms** — the room id embeds a fingerprint of your
  public key; tokens carry the key and are signed by it; the relay trusts a token
  only if the fingerprint matches. No account system, no shared secret. Your
  private key stays in the editor's secure storage.
- **Dependency-free core** — the access-control layer uses only Node's `crypto`.

## How the security model works

A secured room's id is `hs_<fp>_<rand>`, where `fp` is a base64url SHA-256
fingerprint of the owner's public key. Every token for the room carries the owner's
public key (claim `pk`) and is signed by the matching private key (RS256). The relay
trusts a token **iff** `fingerprint(token.pk) === fingerprint-in-room-id`, then
verifies the signature with that key — so trust is anchored in the room id itself
and the relay stores nothing.

Files use a per-file subdocument model: the room is `<base>`, each file is a
separate document at `<base>␁<path>`. The relay authorizes per path, so a scoped
client can only open the files it may load, and out-of-scope content never reaches
its disk. Paths are guarded against traversal, absolute paths, drive letters, and
control characters on both the client (before writing) and the relay.

A full threat/edge-case audit is in [EDGE-CASES.md](EDGE-CASES.md); the RBAC design
is in [RBAC.md](RBAC.md).

## Self-hosting the relay

The hosted relay is the default (`wss://livecode-xoss.onrender.com`) and needs no
setup. To run your own, deploy [`server.js`](server.js) anywhere Node runs and set
`hivecode.relayUrl` in the extension. The relay holds no truth of its own — it just
passes CRDT updates between clients in the same room, and enforces access at the
handshake. See [DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md).
